      - title: Detection of pits in the ground using deep neural networks
        link: "https://github.com/TomislavBratic/Final-thesis"
        tagline: "It was necessary to create an application that will detect possible pits in the ground based on the analysis of the image taken with a camera from a height of 50-150 cm. The work presented an overview of artificial neural networks and their possibilities. It was necessary to create a database of images with positive examples as well as negative examples. Matlab software package was used for the project to perform neural network learning process. The already developed convolutional networks, GoogleNet and SqueezeNet, were used to develop this project. 286 images of pits in the ground were collected for the database. The entire database is stored in a specific variable that will be divided into a part for training and for validation. Options before training were selected, such as Image Data Augmenter, Rand X/Y Reflection, SGDM and more. After finishing validation tests, networks were compared in accuracy, speed and consistency from given results."
